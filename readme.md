## Chattrbox

Chattrbox is a CCMS (Chatterbox is not a CMS) designed around how content editors and developers actually work together. Chattrbox treats content creation as a first-class citizen, and allows developers to use whatever platform or framework they choose for their development. Chattrbox is platform agnostic.

Chattrbox provides content authors and editors the tools they need to write and publish to the web. Developers can access that content through a robust API. 

Chatterbox is completely free and open-source and may be the last CCMS you ever need.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Chattrbox Website](http://chattrbox.org).
